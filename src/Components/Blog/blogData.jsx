      question: "What are the challenges that I faced in this field?",
      answer: "Transitioning into software engineering from a completely different field was daunting. One of the biggest challenges was overcoming my self-doubt and the fear of not having the right qualifications or experience. Initially, understanding and making changes to large production codebases, working alongside senior developers, and learning best practices were incredibly intimidating. Another challenge was balancing my time between studying new technologies, working a full-time job, and overcoming the steep learning curve. However, with persistence, a willingness to ask questions, and the support of mentors, I gradually became more confident and proficient in my role.",

    },
    {
      question: "How did I get started in this field?",
      answer: "I began my journey into software engineering in a rather unconventional way. My background was in life sciences, and I initially pursued a career in psychology. However, my passion for technology, which started at a young age when I taught myself to code to create fan websites, eventually led me back to tech. After years of feeling unfulfilled in my chosen career path, I decided to pivot and explore opportunities in the tech industry. I started by taking on a technical support role, which gave me invaluable exposure to the software industry and ultimately led me to pursue a formal education in computer science. This experience, combined with self-study and determination, helped me transition into a software engineering role.",
